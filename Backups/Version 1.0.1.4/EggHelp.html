<br>
<textarea readonly cols="50" rows="14" name="te" style="font-family:times new romans">
In this game, you basiclly need to press the egg (The picture on the top screen).
Doing that will decrease the amount of clicks until cracking the egg.
After clicking the egg one million times (There is a shop with special items like "Hit x3"
which makes every click of yours be as it was 3 clicks at once), the egg will be cracked
and you will earn a bonus of points.
You can click the "View stats" button to view how many clicks you clicked in total,
how much XP you earned in total, and how many points you ever earned in total!

<br>
<textarea readonly cols="50" rows="5" name="te" style="font-family:times new romans">
With every time you click the egg, you earn points.
One click earns you one point (Though you can earn more using the shop, will be explained later).
With these points you can buy stuff in the shop.

<br>
<textarea readonly cols="50" rows="12" name="te" style="font-family:times new romans">
There are ranks in the game as well.
Every time you click the egg, you earn one XP.
You can see the amount of XP left for a rank up written in "XP left for rankup" section, you can
see your current rank as well, in the "Rank" section.
Earning ranks also gives you points bonuses, depends on how much XP was needed
to rankup.
Also, higher ranks shows that you play a lot, and that you are a good player!
(Note: You can also buy XP in the shop).

<font color="#0404B4" size="4px">Shop and purchased items</font>
<br>
<textarea readonly cols="120" rows="20" name="te" style="font-family:times new romans">
You can find the shop in the "Shop" section.
In the shop, you can buy items which would help you earning points,earning clicks or to rank up faster.
Every item has it's own price of points, if you don't have enough points to buy a certain item, you will not be able to buy it.
When you get enough points to purchase an item, you can go to the shop, click on the item you want to purchase, and then click the "Buy" button.
There would be a message saying that the purchase was successful, and the item should be added right away to "Your items" list. (Crack an egg and buy XP items aren't added to the list, they are just being activated right away).
After you purchased an item, you can activate it by going to "Your items" section, clicking the item and then clicking the "Activate" button.
The item would be activated right away and will give you bonues, depends on what item it is (If there is another item which is activated, the system will
ask you if you want to activate the item, if you choose yes, the current activated item will dissapear and you may lose money).
Every item is activated for 2 hours, then it would dissapear, in that time, you will recieve a bonus, depends on which item it is, for example:
if you purchased and activated the "Hit x3" item, every time you'll click the egg will
be count as if you clicked it 3 times at once.
When you purchase an item more than once, the amount you have from this item will increase.
You can check the amount you have from every item by clicking it in "your items" list.
